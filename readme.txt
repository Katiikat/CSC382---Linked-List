Assignment: Linked List

Assignment Requirements: 
Implement a templated (generics) doubly-linked list.  Your linked list class should implement the following functionality:

	Find(dataToFind) – returns a pointer to the node whose key matches dataToFind.

	Insert(newData) – inserts a new node at the end of the list with a key equal to newData

	Delete(delNode)- deletes the node that delNode points to from the list.

For extra credit, implement a function that finds the Minimum and Maximum values in your linked list.

	Minimum() – returns the minimum key in the list

	Maximum() –returns the maximum key in the list

Your main program should instantiate, initialize and correctly demonstrate the functionality of the linked list.
